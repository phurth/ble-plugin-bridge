# Icon Placeholder

This file is a placeholder. For a production add-on, you should add a PNG icon file named `icon.png` (128x128 pixels or 256x256 pixels recommended).

The icon should visually represent ADB/Android connectivity, such as:
- Android robot with USB cable
- Phone with network symbol
- Bridge icon with Android branding

You can create this using any graphics editor or find a suitable icon from:
- https://materialdesignicons.com/
- https://icons8.com/
- Adobe Illustrator / Figma / Inkscape
